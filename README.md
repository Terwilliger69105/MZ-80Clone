### MZ-80Clone

*A project to recreate (and possibly eventually improve) the Sharp MZ-80C motherboard.*

The [Sharp MZ-80C](https://www.old-computers.com/MUSEUM/computer.asp?c=418&st=1) is a Japanese personal computer from 1979. I bought one in June of 2021, a single unit sitting on Yahoo Auctions Japan kept looking like a damn fun time, and a few months later I'd like to see if I could start doing some hardware development for it.

Now, I don't really want to modify my original motherboard all too much. If it were to die then sure, I would, but until that day I'd enjoy keeping things stock. Finding another computer would be expensive, it was $250 to ship just this computer alone via DHL to the USA, and finding just a motherboard seems near-impossible. Why not make my own motherboard?

**Goal 1:** To create a 1:1 replica of the original motherboard.

**Goal 2:** To modernize some components of the original motherboard, removing things like the 4116 RAM ICs for a cheaper modern solution and giving video output ports to a television set.

**Goal 3:** To modernize more of the motherboard, coming up with a way to use a modern keyboard and removing the cassette mechanism entirely for a flash-based solution.
